I got into manga through solo leveling in 2017, I had explored many Manga's since. My love for manga grew due to the different art forms which were so unique and special in different artists. I got into art through my sisters as they always loved drawing, but I was quite terrible at art and coloring. However I loved art even if I couldn't do art.
